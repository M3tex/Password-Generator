# Password Generator
This basic script allows the user to quickly generate cryptographically safe passwords.

Ideas for future improvements:
- Add a GUI
- Implement a password strength tester (the user inputs a password and the script rates the strength of it)
- Add the possibility to choose specific formats (XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX for example)
